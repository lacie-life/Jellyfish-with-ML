## Machine learning common definitions

- <b>Activation function:</b> This is a function that takes in the weighted sum of all the inputs and outputs a value. This value is then passed to the next layer of the network. <i>(Threshold function, Sigmoid function, Rectified linear unit (ReLU) function, Hyperbolic tangent function)</i>

- <b>Cost function:</b> This is a function that calculates the error of the network. <i>(Mean squared error (MSE), Mean absolute error (MAE), Cross-entropy error)</i>

- <b>Optimizer:</b> They define the value of parameters during the training such that the loss function is at its lowest.

- <b>Backpropagation:</b> This is a method of training a neural network. It is a way of calculating the error of the network and then adjusting the weights of the network to reduce the error. <i>(Stochastic Gradient descent, mini-batch Gradient descent)</i>

- <b>Model training-specific hyperparameters:</b> These are parameters that are not learned by the network. They are set by the user and are used to control the training process. <i>(Learning rate, Number of epochs, Batch size)</i>

- <b>Network architecture-specific hyperparameters:</b> These are parameters that are not learned by the network. They are set by the user and are used to control the architecture of the network. <i>(Number of hidden layers, Number of neurons in each layer, Regularization, Activation function)</i>
